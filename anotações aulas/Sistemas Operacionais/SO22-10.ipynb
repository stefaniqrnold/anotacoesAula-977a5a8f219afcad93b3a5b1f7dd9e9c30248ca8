    "# File Systems in Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructor: Marcelo Friske  \n",
    "**Agenda**:  \n",
    "- Disks and partitions/volumes  \n",
    "  - Block management\n",
    "  - File allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disk Space and Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "In operating systems, a disk is viewed as a large array of blocks (or sectors) with fixed sizes. These blocks are grouped into **partitions** or **volumes**, which are logical storage units within a physical device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage Space is Divided Into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration Area**: \n",
    "    - Contains a partition table describing the partitioning of the device.\n",
    "    - Holds the **Master Boot Record (MBR)**, which contains a small executable code to assist in booting the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitions**: \n",
    "    - Each partition contains a **Volume Boot Record (VBR)**, located at the beginning of the partition. This records the details of the partition and possibly holds boot code for the OS.\n",
    "    - The rest of the partition consists of storage blocks for user files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of FAT Organization\n",
    "- **Sector 0**: Boot Sector.\n",
    "- **Sector 1 and 2**: FAT Location.\n",
    "- **Sector 3 and 4**: Copy of FAT.\n",
    "- **Sector 5 to 11**: Directory entries.\n",
    "- **Sector 12 and onward**: File data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Block management is a layer in the OS responsible for interacting with device drivers and managing block data transfer. It maps **physical blocks** (512 or 4096 bytes in size) to **logical blocks** (a group of physical blocks). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical blocks** help simplify management and improve read/write performance by transferring larger groups of data. Logical block sizes can range from 4 KB to 64 KB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- A 1 GB disk may contain over a billion 512-byte blocks.\n",
    "- A logical block size of 32 KB can group 64 physical blocks for more efficient data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Block Size and System Capacity\n",
    "The logical block size directly affects the storage system's total capacity. For example, with FAT32:\n",
    "- A 4 KB block size can address up to 1 TB.\n",
    "- A 64 KB block size can address up to 16 TB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Block caching is a mechanism where blocks are stored temporarily in **RAM** to improve performance. Since disk access is relatively slow, caching helps reduce the latency of read/write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read-through**: The requested block is delivered from cache if available. If not, it's read from disk and added to the cache for future requests.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Read-ahead**: In addition to the requested block, adjacent blocks are also loaded into cache to speed up sequential read operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write-through**: Data is written directly to disk, with the cache maintaining a copy for subsequent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write-back**: Data is initially written to cache and then committed to disk later. This boosts performance but poses a risk of data loss if a system crash occurs before the data is flushed to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Allocation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "File allocation is the process of assigning blocks to store file contents. The choice of allocation method impacts system performance and file organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Contiguous Allocation**\n",
    "Files are stored in sequential blocks. This provides fast access, but leads to **external fragmentation**, where there may be enough total space but not enough contiguous space to store large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- If a file requires 1 GB and is allocated contiguous 4 KB blocks, 262,144 blocks are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "- Fast sequential and random access.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Low flexibility. Fragmentation makes it difficult to find large contiguous spaces, and files must be resized with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Chained Allocation**\n",
    "Each file block contains a pointer to the next block, creating a **linked list** of blocks. This avoids the need for contiguous space and eliminates external fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "- High flexibility; files do not need contiguous blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Slow random access, as each block must be read sequentially to find a specific part of the file.\n",
    "- Vulnerable to errors: If one block becomes corrupted, the rest of the file becomes inaccessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAT Allocation (File Allocation Table)\n",
    "To improve chained allocation, FAT stores all block pointers in a **centralized table** rather than inside each block. This allows faster file access and better error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Indexed Allocation**\n",
    "Rather than chaining blocks, indexed allocation uses an **index block** to store pointers to all the file's blocks. This allows for direct access to any block and eliminates both fragmentation and access delays caused by chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- In UNIX, **i-nodes** are used to store file metadata and block pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Efficient access for both sequential and random operations.\n",
    "- High robustness, as block errors do not affect other file blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Limited file size, as the number of block pointers in an index is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-level Indexed Allocation\n",
    "For larger files, multi-level indexing is used, where pointers can point to other blocks of pointers, forming a tree structure. This greatly increases the maximum file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- A system with 4 KB blocks and 32-bit pointers can store 1024 block pointers per block, allowing very large files to be managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mounting and Unmounting Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a volume can be used, it needs to be **mounted** by the OS. Mounting involves reading the volume's boot block, creating data structures in memory, and assigning an identifier to the volume for access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mounting on initialization**: Disk drives are mounted during system boot.\n",
    "- **Mounting after initialization**: Removable media (e.g., USB drives) can be mounted manually after the system has started.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unmounting** releases all resources and closes all open files, safely removing the volume from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Systems** allow efficient management of files on disk, with partitions, volumes, and block management optimizing data access.\n",
    "- **File Allocation** strategies (contiguous, chained, and indexed) play a critical role in file organization and system performance.\n",
    "- **Caching** significantly improves performance by storing frequently accessed blocks in memory.\n",
    "- **Mounting/Unmounting** volumes enables the system to dynamically manage different storage devices, ensuring data is accessible and safe during disconnection.\n"
